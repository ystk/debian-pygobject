  * debian/rules:
    + Don't abort if the test suite fails on hurd.
    + We build for all the available python flavours. Previously we
      were removing the prefix to which we install before installing
      each flavour. We didn't notice any problems because we were
      building only once for python3, but now that we build for 3.2
      and 3.3, let's not remove the python3.2 bits when we install
      the 3.3 stuff. This fixes pygobject on python3.2. Closes: #707318.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/rules: The test suite causes an eternal hang on Debian's buildds,

  * Add autopkgtests for the -dbg flavours of Python 2 and 3.
  * debian/control.in: Have python-gi-dev depend on python3-gi, too.
    (LP: #1101683)

  * Enable again gtk3 on m68k.
  * Add missing dependency python3-gi-cairo â†’ python3-gi. (Closes: #673213)

  * Stop using a doc symlink for the dbg package. The space savings are
    negligible and they are prone to cause problems. In case of
    python-gobject-dbg, which was converted to a transitional package, the
    symlink was mistakenly converted to a real directory which isn't handled
    nicely by dpkg. (Closes: #700779)

  * Drop quilt (not necessary, we are using 3.0 (quilt) source format), and
    dh_autoreconf (we have no patches).
  * Greatly simplify debian/rules, by switching to dh7 build system and
    factorizing the per-flavor rules in a simpler and better way. Also move to
    dh compat 9 to get multiarch compatible library directories.
  * debian/control.in: Bump g-i requirement according to upstream
    configure.ac.
  * debian/control.in: Drop support for Python 2.6. It's going to be dropped
    after Wheezy anyway, it receives zero testing by upstream and will soon be
    dropped upstream anyway.
  * debian/rules: Use py3versions --supported instead of --requested; the
    former is broken right now and we don't request particular versions anyway.
  * debian/control.in: Add missing ${misc:Pre-Depends} and versioned dpkg-dev
    build dependency.

pygobject (2.90.3-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: Bring back python-gobject-dev package, to
    ship the include and pkg-config file. This is still needed by e. g.
    libpeas. Depend on python-gobject-2-dev to retain backwards compatibility,
    similar to the other binary packages.

pygobject (2.90.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add revert-refcount-fix.patch: Revert
    http://git.gnome.org/browse/pygobject/commit/?id=7bc4122897 as a
    workaround for segfaults when creating custom widgets through the GObject
    constructor (such as through GtkBuilder). This works around
    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=657403. This patch was reverted
    in the 2-28 branch as well, so reverting it here is no regression from
    2.28. (LP: #834168)

pygobject (2.90.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in: Update Vcs-* for experimental branch.
  * New upstream release:
    - New rewritten invoker is twice as fast and easier to extend and debug
    - Complete break from static bindings so we may improve the core without
      breaking legacy APIs
    - Better type handling
    - Parallel installable with PyGObject 2.28 for legacy binding support
      (2.28 must be compiled with â€“disable-introspection)
    - Fixed object array handling
    - Added more overrides for PyGTK API emulation
    - Support for function calling using keyword arguments
    - GObject and GLib symbols can now have overrides
    - All static bit removed or made private
    - GVariants now work from callback returns
    - Note that this now enforces a consistent move to the GI bindings. I. e.
      you need to change all "import gobject" statements into "from
      gi.repository import GObject", same for glib.
   * Drop debian/patches/00git_*.patch, all upstream.
   * Drop 20_deprecated_spam.patch, obsolete.
   * debian/control.in: The static bindings (glib, gobject, pygtk, gtk, etc.)
     are deprecated and are now shipped in the separate packages
     python-gobject-2{,-dbg}. Add a dependency to these for the time being to
     not break backwards compatibility. Once all packages have been ported to
     use the GI bindings, this dependency and pygobject-2 will be dropped.
   * debian/control.in: Update package descriptions to point out that this is
     now GI only.
   * debian/control.in, debian/rules: Drop python-gobject-dev package. It's
     not relevant any more for this version, and now built from the
     pygobject-2 source package.
  * debian/rules: Bump shlibs.
  * Drop debian/python-gobject.examples: These are for the old static
    bindings. http://git.gnome.org/browse/pygobject/tree/demos is an actually
    useful and comprehensive example, but not shipped in the release tarballs.
  * debian/rules: Drop obsolete permission fixing, that only applied to the
    examples.

pygobject (2.28.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Cherrypick some fixes from pygobject-2-28 upstream branch:
    - 00git_test_case_hang.patch: Fix hang in test suite when
      TestGDBusClient.test_native_calls_async() test case fails.
    - 00git_messagebox_type.patch: Fix MessageBox so it correctly handles
      the type constructor param.
    - 00git_python3_build.patch, 00git_python3-maketrans.patch: Python 3 fixes.
    - 00git_gio_test.patch: Port test_properties from static gio to GI Gio, so
      that the tests will also work with Python 3.
  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: Add and build python3-gobject and
    python3-gobject-dbg packages. Until we get py3cairo packaged in Debian (in
    the works), we need to build the python3 flavour with --disable-cairo, and
    apply some workarounds in debian/rules (see the "FIXME"s); these will
    disappear again with py3cairo.

  * debian/rules: Move from pysupport (which is being deprecated) to
    dh_python2. Drop python-support build dependency.
    (Closes: #614764)
  * debian/rules: Install a library search path for a pysupport compatible
    gtk-2.0 directory, to avoid instantly breaking all reverse dependencies.
    This needs to stay until they get converted to dh_python2.
  * Fix test suite calls during package build (Closes: #619257):
    - debian/rules: Copy Python files from our modules into build tree, so
      that the tests actually find them. In Python you can't have Python
      modules and compiled extensions which belong to the same import in
      different directories. (Unfortunately it's hard to upstream this, so
      keep it as a Debian specific hack for now.)
    - debian/rules: Run the tests under xvfb so that the Gdk/Gtk ones can
      succeed.
    - debian/rules: Disable fakeroot for the tests by unsetting $LD_PRELOAD.
      Otherwise the tests try to connect to root's session D-BUS.
    - debian/control.in: Add build dependencies: xvfb (as we now use it in
      debian/rules), dbus-x11 (as the test suite uses dbus-launch), and
      python-apt-dbg/python-cairo-dbg, so that the test cases for the debug
      builds have all dependencies met.
